# Career-Connect
Career Connect is a dynamic and responsive job portal built using the MERN stack, designed to simplify and streamline the job search and recruitment process. This full-stack web application connects job seekers with employers on a single platform, offering an efficient and user-friendly experience.

The frontend, developed using React.js, provides an intuitive user interface with role-based dashboards for both candidates and employers. Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Job seekers can browse job listings, apply with a single click, and track their applications. Employers can post jobs, view applicants, and manage openings through a personalized dashboard.

The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles RESTful API calls, user authentication (using JWT and bcrypt), and secure data handling. MongoDB serves as the database, storing user profiles, job listings, and application records in a structured and scalable format.
